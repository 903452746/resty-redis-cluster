# resty-redis-cluster
Openresty lua client for redis cluster.

This client would support the usual access request to redis cluster.Currently openresty has no good client which can completely
support our project requirements, so I develop one. The client has some reference with cuiweixie's lua client:
https://github.com/cuiweixie/lua-resty-redis-cluster.   Thanks for this is a good baseline for me to start!
